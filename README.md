# Jim

Jim (Jupyter in macOS) is a simple, beautiful Jupyter notebook editor for macOS. Think [Bear](https://bear.app/), for [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).

**NB: Jim is in pre-alpha and therefore not yet very reliable. You may lose work due to an unknown bug. Use Jim at your own risk.**

## Contributing

All contributions to Jim are welcome! Here's how you can get Jim up and running on your computer.

### Get the project source

First ensure that you have installed [XCode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) from the app store.

Then clone this repo:

``` sh
git clone git@github.com:seeM/Jim.git
```

Open the project, either in XCode directly or via the command line:

``` sh
open Jim/Jim.xcodeproj
```

### Start a Jupyter Server

Jim connects to an existing [Jupyter Server](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which must be started either in another process or remotely. Install Jupyter Server if needed with:

``` sh
pip install jupyter-server
```

Then start the server:

``` sh
jupyter server
```

Note the server URL and token displayed in the logs, which are needed to login with Jim. For example, if your Jupyter Server produced the following logs:

```         
[C 2023-05-27 15:01:55.088 ServerApp]

    To access the server, open this file in a browser:
        file:///Users/seem/Library/Jupyter/runtime/jpserver-5988-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://localhost:8888/?token=6dc6eebb717ed09c243da57a89bee6a30dba217fbd43ec15
        http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=6dc6eebb717ed09c243da57a89bee6a30dba217fbd43ec15
```

The corresponding login URL would be `http://localhost:8888/` and the token would be `6dc6eebb717ed09c243da57a89bee6a30dba217fbd43ec15`

***Note: Jim doesn't yet have a login screen (see [issue #15](https://github.com/seeM/Jim/issues/15#issue-1676257828)). The login URL and token are currently hardcoded [here](https://github.com/seeM/Jim/blob/7e14cd8e70df1057c6888e9126c3524066a41db5/Jim/Main/SidebarViewController.swift#L21). You can use the command `jupyter server --port 8999 --ServerApp.token=testtoken123` to quickly create a development server, or change those values to match your server's configuration.***
